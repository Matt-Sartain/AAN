<h3>Manage Publishers</h3>
<p>
The Manage Publishers section of the Atrinsic Affiliate Network is where you will manage your publisher recruitment, pending publisher applications, and your current publishers.  
</p>
<h4>Recruit Publishers</h4>
<p>
Recruiting Publishers for your program can easily be done by the Publishers Company Name, by filtering for a date range of when the publisher joined, by a category/vertical, or by entering a rating
</p>

<p>
Once you’ve filtered for your specific needs you will be presented with a list of Publishers that fit the criteria you’ve entered.  From here you can recruit said Publishers or Compose in system email to ask them more questions about their methods.
</p>

<h4>My Publishers</h4>
<p>
My Publishers will show you a complete list of who is currently partnered with you to promote your product.  It can be filtered the same way Recruit Publishers is set up.  Additionally, you can extend Program Terms, Expire partnerships, and Group affiliates from this section. 	
</p>

<h4>Pending Applications</h4>
<p>
Your Pending Applications from Publishers are located under the Manage Publishers section.  From here you can review the Publishers rating, EPC, and website.  You can choose to decline or accept them as a partner in your program. 
</p>
<h4>Groups</h4>
<p>
The Groups menu allows you to subdivide your publisher partners in order to better target specific information to specific clusters.  Examples include grouping your top twenty five publishing partners together to contact about exclusive offers, or your partners whom promote via email for updates about email campaigns.
