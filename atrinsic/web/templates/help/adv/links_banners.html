<h3>Managing Links and Banners</h3>
<p>
Atrinsic Affiliate Network allows you to add links individually and in batches by downloading templates located in the Help bar under Upload Multiple.  
</p>
<p>
When uploading batches of banners you must choose to host the images or to use the Upload Images and have them hosted on the Atrinsic Affiliate Network.    
</p>
<h4>Links</h4>
<p>
The main menu when looking to managing your links shows the link type, the count and provides buttons to add or edit the specific link type within the network.   Clicking the link type will take you to a list of the current links of that type you have loaded into the network.  If you find that you are at the maximum allowed amount of a specific link you can contact your account manager to have this number changed.
</p>
<p>
From the link type list view you are able to edit specific links (landing page URL, text, image URL, etc.) or delete the link itself from the network. 
</p>

<p>
Best Practice Tip: If a specific link or banner is no longer to be used when promoting your offer it is best to change the wording and/or replace the image with the new banner of the same size so as not to create dead links or broken images on your partners page.
</p>
<h4>Uploading Multiple Images</h4>
<p>
You can upload a zip file to upload multiple images at a time to the server or you may upload one image at a time.
</p>
<P>
File types must be jpeg, .jpg, .gif or .png and less than 200 KB in file size.   
</P>
<P>
Advertisers are allowed a maximum of 50 images for each account. Please contact your account manager should you need more.
</P>
<P>
If you are uploading a zip file, use the browse button to locate and select the file. Enter an email address to receive a confirmation email when your upload has completed. Once you have entered your confirmation email, click "Upload".
</P>
<P>
You will receive a confirmation email with a list of the image urls once the upload is complete.
</P>
<P>
Note that you may not delete an image if it is associated with an active link within the interface.
