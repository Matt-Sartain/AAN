<h3>Settings</h3>
<p>
Under Settings from the Main navigation menu you are able to access a host of options to control, inform and report on your program.
</p>
<p>
The only option allowed to be edited on the settings home screen is the addition of secondary verticals.  All other information is locked and must be edited by contacting your Atrinsic Affiliate Network point of contact.
</p>
<h4>Users</h4>
<p>
Users are where you will add the multiple program users that will be working within your program.  This list serves as a contact list for the network when sending updates, information and alerts.  One of the Users must be set as the Admin and the first user entered will be Admin by default.
</p>
<h4>Setting Up Alerts</h4>
<p>
Alerts are a powerful tool that allows you to customize your program to inform you of significant changes in traffic and payouts across your publisher base.  Using alerts will help you to target publishers who may need help in properly promoting your products as well as give you insight into publishers who are generally doing an above average job generating traffic.
</p>
<p>
Select Settings from the main menu, and then select Alerts from the sub menu.  Click Add Alert to bring up the criteria settings for your new alert.   Select what you wish to be notified about and then select the time frame over which the alert should happen.
</p>
<p>
You can add multiple alerts and all alerts will be displayed on the Dashboard with your reports when you first log in. 
</p>
<h4>Application Filters</h4>
<p>
The Application Filter allows you to pre-screen your Publisher applications. Publishers who match the filter settings will be automatically declined for your program. Please note that applications to your program are filtered based on the information the Publisher submits when registering for the network.
</p>
<p>
These filters are useful when managing your own account and targeting publishers operating within a specific vertical.
</p>
<p>
Best Practice Tip: If you are unable to commit the resources to work within your affiliate program each and every day setting up the proper filters to handle the incoming applications will greatly help to reduce manual work load and keep publishers from waiting for a response to their application into the program.
</p>
<h4>Publisher Page Settings</h4>
<p>
Creating a Branded Signup Page for attracting affiliates is easy.  When a publisher visits our network to join your program, you may lead them to a branded sign-up form, hosted by our network.  We encourage you to customize the look and feel of the form to match your Web site. 
</p>
<p>
Additionally, you can create a Publisher Program Page.  A network hosted Publisher Program page allows you to make real-time updates to any information about your program.  Atrinsic Interactive SEO team is available to optimize your Publisher Program page and our design team can assist you in the development of the page look and feel.  Contact your network account manager for development of a custom page.
</p>
<p>
Finally, customizing the Publisher Profile View for a Publisher to view.  When a Publisher is reviewing Advertisers within our network, they have the ability to see a snapshot of your company and program profile which should include your payout, search policy overview and benefits to customers.  All of which can be customized using HTML here.
</p>
<h4>Program Settings</h4>
<p>
Access the Program Settings from the Settings menu on the main navigation menu.  Once here you can enter your default program terms by selecting Add Program.   
</p>
<p>
Continuing on enter your Default Program Term.  On the following screen you will select the Action from the drop down and enter the Cookie duration in the Action Referral period.    
</p>
<p>
In the case of the program being commission based check fixed commission and enter the commission amount.   
</p>
<p>
Once all the pertinent information is entered click Add Action and then Save Program.  Repeat these steps to add additional Program Settings for private offers.  
</p>
<h4>Data Feeds</h4>
<p>
Atrinsic Affiliate Network allows for Data Feeds to be requested and implemented to better provide Publishers with a list of promoted products for them to push traffic too.  All feeds are provided as an FTP Push, FTP Pull, or HTTP Pull format and can be flat files with comma, pipe, or tab delimiters or even just a regular Excel file.    
</p>
<p>
Once a Data Feed is requested it will be reviewed and approved by Atrinsic Affiliate Network Admin.  You will then be contacted with the Data Feed Integration guide details which will provide the necessary values to set-up your feed.  
</p>
<h4>SKU Lists</h4>
<p>
SKU Lists are a detailed list, in flat file format, of products and merchandise available for commission to your Publishers.  They are used when itemized commissions are necessary for the wide range of products your company may have to offer.  Item based commission should be discussed and setup prior to account launch, or in the instance of a change to your program model, prior to SKU List addition with your Network Account Manager.
</p>
<h4>Real Time Box Settings</h4>
<p>
Atrinsic Affiliate Network provides a real time account of all things happening within your program.   This information appears in the upper right hand corner of the Atrinsic Affiliate Network.  You can change the real time ticker variable to display a myriad of information including but not limited to Impressions, Clicks, Sales, and Commission Earned.
