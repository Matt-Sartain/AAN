<h3>Checking Network Messages</h3>
<p>
Messages from your Advertisers and announcements from the Network itself can be found in your Network inbox.  You can easily see when you have new images based on the message icon located on the main navigation bar in the upper right hand corner.

Clicking the message icon or clicking Messages in the main navigation bar will take you to your inbox where you can read and compose your inner Network messages.  Additionally, you can change the settings for receiving notifications to your on file email address by clicking settings on the sub menu bar.
