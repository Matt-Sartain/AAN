<h3>Running Reports</h3>
<p>
The Atrinsic Affiliate Network has built in reporting that allows you to track the progress of your Publisher relationships.  Reporting is accessed by clicking Reports on the main navigation bar.

<p>
Reports can be further broken down by time frame, publisher, and vertical. You will need to select a start and end date for the report before running the report. Select a report type and run report.

Once a report has been run the columns can be sorted easily by clicking on a column header. Furthermore reports can be downloaded, or changed between three separate views by accessing the report menu by clicking the plus icon on the bottom left of the report results.
