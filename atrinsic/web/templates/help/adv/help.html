    <div class="primaryDisplayTableHdr primaryDisplayTableHdrLrg">Manage Publishers</div>
    <div class="helpText">
        <p>
        The Manage Publishers section of the Atrinsic Affiliate Network is where you will manage your publisher recruitment, pending publisher applications, and your current publishers.  
        </p>
        <h4>Recruit Publishers</h4>
        <p>
        Recruiting Publishers for your program can easily be done by the Publishers Company Name, by filtering for a date range of when the publisher joined, by a category/vertical, or by entering a rating
        </p>
        
        <p>
        Once you’ve filtered for your specific needs you will be presented with a list of Publishers that fit the criteria you’ve entered.  From here you can recruit said Publishers or Compose in system email to ask them more questions about their methods.
        </p>
        
        <h4>My Publishers</h4>
        <p>
        My Publishers will show you a complete list of who is currently partnered with you to promote your product.  It can be filtered the same way Recruit Publishers is set up.  Additionally, you can extend Program Terms, Expire partnerships, and Group affiliates from this section. 	
        </p>
        
        <h4>Pending Applications</h4>
        <p>
        Your Pending Applications from Publishers are located under the Manage Publishers section.  From here you can review the Publishers rating, EPC, and website.  You can choose to decline or accept them as a partner in your program. 
        </p>
        <h4>Groups</h4>
        <p>
        The Groups menu allows you to subdivide your publisher partners in order to better target specific information to specific clusters.  Examples include grouping your top twenty five publishing partners together to contact about exclusive offers, or your partners whom promote via email for updates about email campaigns.
        </p>

<div class="contentCtn profileView" id="helpManageLinks" style="display:none;">
    <div class="primaryDisplayTableHdr primaryDisplayTableHdrLrg">Managing Links and Banners</div>
    <div class="helpText">
        <p>
        Atrinsic Affiliate Network allows you to add links individually and in batches by downloading templates located in the Help bar under Upload Multiple.  
        </p>
        <p>
        When uploading batches of banners you must choose to host the images or to use the Upload Images and have them hosted on the Atrinsic Affiliate Network.    
        </p>
        <h4>Links</h4>
        <p>
        The main menu when looking to managing your links shows the link type, the count and provides buttons to add or edit the specific link type within the network.   Clicking the link type will take you to a list of the current links of that type you have loaded into the network.  If you find that you are at the maximum allowed amount of a specific link you can contact your account manager to have this number changed.
        </p>
        <p>
        From the link type list view you are able to edit specific links (landing page URL, text, image URL, etc.) or delete the link itself from the network. 
        </p>
        
        <p>
        Best Practice Tip: If a specific link or banner is no longer to be used when promoting your offer it is best to change the wording and/or replace the image with the new banner of the same size so as not to create dead links or broken images on your partners page.
        </p>
        <h4>Uploading Multiple Images</h4>
        <p>
        You can upload a zip file to upload multiple images at a time to the server or you may upload one image at a time.
        </p>
        <P>
        File types must be jpeg, .jpg, .gif or .png and less than 200 KB in file size.   
        </P>
        <P>
        Advertisers are allowed a maximum of 50 images for each account. Please contact your account manager should you need more.
        </P>
        <P>
        If you are uploading a zip file, use the browse button to locate and select the file. Enter an email address to receive a confirmation email when your upload has completed. Once you have entered your confirmation email, click "Upload".
        </P>
        <P>
        You will receive a confirmation email with a list of the image urls once the upload is complete.
        </P>
        <P>
        Note that you may not delete an image if it is associated with an active link within the interface.
        </P>
        <h4>Uploading Links for All Publishers</h4>

    <div class="helpText">
        <p>
        Under Settings from the Main navigation menu you are able to access a host of options to control, inform and report on your program.
        </p>
        <p>
        The only option allowed to be edited on the settings home screen is the addition of secondary verticals.  All other information is locked and must be edited by contacting your Atrinsic Affiliate Network point of contact.
        </p>
        <h4>Users</h4>
        <p>
        Users are where you will add the multiple program users that will be working within your program.  This list serves as a contact list for the network when sending updates, information and alerts.  One of the Users must be set as the Admin and the first user entered will be Admin by default.
        </p>
        <h4>Setting Up Alerts</h4>
        <p>
        Alerts are a powerful tool that allows you to customize your program to inform you of significant changes in traffic and payouts across your publisher base.  Using alerts will help you to target publishers who may need help in properly promoting your products as well as give you insight into publishers who are generally doing an above average job generating traffic.
        </p>
        <p>
        Select Settings from the main menu, and then select Alerts from the sub menu.  Click Add Alert to bring up the criteria settings for your new alert.   Select what you wish to be notified about and then select the time frame over which the alert should happen.
        </p>
        <p>
        You can add multiple alerts and all alerts will be displayed on the Dashboard with your reports when you first log in. 
        </p>
        <h4>Application Filters</h4>
        <p>
        The Application Filter allows you to pre-screen your Publisher applications. Publishers who match the filter settings will be automatically declined for your program. Please note that applications to your program are filtered based on the information the Publisher submits when registering for the network.
        </p>
        <p>
        These filters are useful when managing your own account and targeting publishers operating within a specific vertical.
        </p>
        <p>
        Best Practice Tip: If you are unable to commit the resources to work within your affiliate program each and every day setting up the proper filters to handle the incoming applications will greatly help to reduce manual work load and keep publishers from waiting for a response to their application into the program.
        </p>
        <h4>Publisher Page Settings</h4>
        <p>
        Creating a Branded Signup Page for attracting affiliates is easy.  When a publisher visits our network to join your program, you may lead them to a branded sign-up form, hosted by our network.  We encourage you to customize the look and feel of the form to match your Web site. 
        </p>
        <p>
        Additionally, you can create a Publisher Program Page.  A network hosted Publisher Program page allows you to make real-time updates to any information about your program.  Atrinsic Interactive SEO team is available to optimize your Publisher Program page and our design team can assist you in the development of the page look and feel.  Contact your network account manager for development of a custom page.
        </p>
        <p>
        Finally, customizing the Publisher Profile View for a Publisher to view.  When a Publisher is reviewing Advertisers within our network, they have the ability to see a snapshot of your company and program profile which should include your payout, search policy overview and benefits to customers.  All of which can be customized using HTML here.
        </p>
        <h4>Program Settings</h4>
        <p>
        Access the Program Settings from the Settings menu on the main navigation menu.  Once here you can enter your default program terms by selecting Add Program.   
        </p>
        <p>
        Continuing on enter your Default Program Term.  On the following screen you will select the Action from the drop down and enter the Cookie duration in the Action Referral period.    
        </p>
        <p>
        In the case of the program being commission based check fixed commission and enter the commission amount.   
        </p>
        <p>
        Once all the pertinent information is entered click Add Action and then Save Program.  Repeat these steps to add additional Program Settings for private offers.  
        </p>
        <h4>Data Feeds</h4>
        <p>
        Atrinsic Affiliate Network allows for Data Feeds to be requested and implemented to better provide Publishers with a list of promoted products for them to push traffic too.  All feeds are provided as an FTP Push, FTP Pull, or HTTP Pull format and can be flat files with comma, pipe, or tab delimiters or even just a regular Excel file.    
        </p>
        <p>
        Once a Data Feed is requested it will be reviewed and approved by Atrinsic Affiliate Network Admin.  You will then be contacted with the Data Feed Integration guide details which will provide the necessary values to set-up your feed.  
        </p>
        <h4>SKU Lists</h4>
        <p>
        SKU Lists are a detailed list, in flat file format, of products and merchandise available for commission to your Publishers.  They are used when itemized commissions are necessary for the wide range of products your company may have to offer.  Item based commission should be discussed and setup prior to account launch, or in the instance of a change to your program model, prior to SKU List addition with your Network Account Manager.
        </p>
        <h4>Real Time Box Settings</h4>
        <p>
        Atrinsic Affiliate Network provides a real time account of all things happening within your program.   This information appears in the upper right hand corner of the Atrinsic Affiliate Network.  You can change the real time ticker variable to display a myriad of information including but not limited to Impressions, Clicks, Sales, and Commission Earned.
