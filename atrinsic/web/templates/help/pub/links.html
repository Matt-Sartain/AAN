<h3>3 Retrieving Links and Banners</h3>

You can easily access the available links of all the programs you’ve joined in two ways.  The first is to simply click the “get links” icon on the quick launch bar in the lower left of your screen [IMAGE 08].

Additionally you can access this page from the main navigation bar by clicking “Links”.  From the Links screen you’ll be able to filter the available links by type, vertical, and promotion type.  Links will appear as program badges and selecting the link icon allows you to obtain the HTML needed for your page.
