<h3>5 Running Reports</h3>

The Atrinsic Affiliate Network has built in reporting that allows you to track the progress of your Advertiser relationships.  Reporting is accessed by clicking Reports on the main navigation bar.
<br /><br />
Reports can be further broken down by time frame, advertiser, and vertical.  You will need to select a start and end date for the report before running the report.  Select a report type and run report.
