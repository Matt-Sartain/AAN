        <br />

        10.2&nbsp;<em>Duty of Care</em>.&nbsp; You will keep all reports, data and    other confidential information provided to You through the Network Publisher    Account Area or otherwise strictly confidential.&nbsp; Without Atrinsic’s    prior written consent, You will not disclose any such confidential    information to any third party or use any such confidential information other    than solely as and to the extent required for You to exercise Your rights and    perform Your obligations under this Agreement and/or Your Engagements with    Atrinsic or any Network Advertisers.<br />

        11.1&nbsp;<em>Network Advertiser Responsible for Payment</em>. You acknowledge    and agree that the Network Advertisers with which you enter Engagements or    other agreements are solely responsible for any and all payments that may be    due to You from time to time pursuant to the terms of such Engagements or    agreements.  Your entitlement to any    compensation reported with respect to any Tracked Activity is solely a    function of the terms of such Engagements and agreements.  Atrinsic shall not be responsible for the    payment or collection of any amounts due to You from any Network    Advertiser.  Atrinsic’s sole    responsibility is to remit to You amounts actually received by Atrinsic from    Network Advertisers in payment for services rendered by You under the applicable    Engagement or other agreement. If Atrinsic undertakes to collect an amount    due to You from a Network Advertiser, any and all costs incurred by Atrinsic    in connection with such collection shall be paid out of the amount so    collected.  &nbsp; You further    acknowledge that, Your entitlement to any compensation reported with respect    to any Tracked Activity is subject to, and will be distributed subsequent to,    Atrinsic’s receipt of funds from the Network Advertiser associated with the    applicable Engagement giving rise to the purported compensation.<br />
        <br />
        11.2&nbsp;<em>Payment Terms</em>.&nbsp; The fact that a compensation amount is    reported for any Tracked Activity does not necessarily mean that a payment is    due to You from the applicable Network Advertiser or from Atrinsic, since payment    may be subject to conditions established by that Network Advertiser and/or    Atrinsic, including policies regarding order cancellation, returned    merchandise, receipt of pending credit card authorizations and/or chargebacks    and minimums for earned compensation before payment is made.  Further, Atrinsic reserves the right to    deduct for direct and indirect fees and expenses incurred arising out of    precluded activities in its sole discretion.<br />
        <br />
        11.3&nbsp;<em>Atrinsic’s Right to Assess Fees</em>.&nbsp; Atrinsic may, at any    time upon prior written notice to You as described below, commence charging    or assessing fees in relation to any or all Network Offerings made available    to You including Your participation on the Affiliate Network(s).&nbsp; Except    as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement, in the event Atrinsic    elects to charge or assess fees, You will be notified at least one (1) month    in advance in writing by email or posting through the Network Publisher    Account Area.&nbsp; You may elect not to pay any such fees by discontinuing    Your participation in all Network Offerings prior to the commencement of such    fees.&nbsp; Any and all fees or other charges may be offset against or    debited from any amounts that might be held in account for You by Atrinsic or    Atrinsic Related Parties including any amounts that may be due, payable or    paid to You by any Network Advertisers, by Atrinsic, or by other third    parties.&nbsp; <br />
